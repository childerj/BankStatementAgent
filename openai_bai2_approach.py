You are a BAI2 (Bank Administration Institute) file format expert. Generate a complete, properly formatted BAI2 file based on the provided bank statement data.

BANK INFORMATION:
- Bank Name: {bank_info.get('bank_name', 'Unknown Bank')}
- Account Number: {account_number}
- Routing Number: {routing_number}
- Account Type: Business Checking

EXTRACTED STATEMENT DATA:
{extracted_data}

BAI2 FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
1. File Header (01): Include proper originator/receiver IDs, file date/time
2. Group Header (02): Use routing number as group ID
3. Account Identifier (03): Include account number, USD currency, type code 010
4. Summary Records (88): Include all required balance and transaction summaries
5. Transaction Detail Records (16): One record per transaction with proper type codes
6. Account Trailer (49): Correct control total and record count
7. Group Trailer (98): Proper group control totals
8. File Trailer (99): Final file control totals and record counts

TRANSACTION TYPE CODES:
- Deposits/Credits: Use code 301 (ACH Credit) or 022 (Deposit)
- Checks/Debits: Use code 451 (ACH Debit) or 475 (Check Paid)
- Fees: Use code 108 (Service Charge)

CONTROL TOTALS:
- Account trailer (49): Use ending balance in cents
- Group trailer (98): Sum of account control totals
- File trailer (99): Sum of group control totals

DATE FORMATTING:
- File dates: YYMMDD format
- Transaction dates: Group transactions by date

FIELD FORMATTING:
- All monetary amounts in cents (no decimal points)
- Proper field separators (commas)
- Record terminators (/)
- Extension codes (Z for end of data)

Generate a complete BAI2 file that would be accepted by standard banking systems. Ensure all record counts, control totals, and field formats are correct.

Return ONLY the BAI2 file content, no explanations or additional text.
